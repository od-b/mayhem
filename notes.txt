pygame.math.Vector2.length_squared() -> float
    * returns the squared Euclidean length of the vector.
    calculates the Euclidean length of the vector which follows from the 
    Pythagorean theorem: vec.length_squared() == vec.x**2 + vec.y**2. 
    This is faster than vec.length() because it avoids the square root.
